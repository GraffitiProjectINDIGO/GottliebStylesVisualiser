# Gottlieb Styles Visualiser (GSV)

<p align="justify">This repository holds the MATLAB code for a small program (called the Gottlieb Styles Visualiser or GSV) that visualises the graffiti style classification system introduced by Lisa Gottlieb in her 2008 book:</br>
<i>Gottlieb, L. 2008. Graffiti art styles: A classification system and theoretical analysis. McFarland & Company: Jefferson, pp. viii, 212. ISBN: 978-0-7864-3436-7</i></p>

This small program was developed within <a href="https://projectindigo.eu"> project INDIGO</a>, an academic graffiti project. GSV can be run in two different ways:
<ul>
<li>the <b>GottliebStylesVisualiser.m</b> file holds the MATLAB R2022a source code. <a href="https://github.com/GraffitiProjectINDIGO/GottliebStyles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download this file</a>, unzip it and run it within MATLAB to open GSV. Please also download the <b>coverBookGottlieb.jpg</b> image file and place it in the same folder as the MATLAB *.m file.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GraffitiProjectINDIGO/GottliebStyles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download</a> <b>InstallerGSV1.0.exe</b>. After unzipping, double-click this file to start installing GSV and the MATLAB R2022a Runtime Environment (v9.12). In this way, MATLAB is not needed to work with GSV.</li>
When choosing this option, please be aware that:
<ol>
<li>the *.exe file was compiled on Windows 10 and will not work on MacOS and Linux systems;</li>
<li>it takes some time for the installer to open;</li>
<li>around 700 MB of data will be downloaded for the MATLAB R2022a Runtime Environment;</li>
<li>running GSV for the first time takes a few moments. Also the menu items require some time to respond upon first use. After that, the GSV program should be much more responsive.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
