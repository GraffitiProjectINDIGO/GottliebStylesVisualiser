# Gottlieb Styles Visualiser (GSV)

This repository holds the MATLAB code for a small program (called the Gottlieb Styles Visualiser or GSV) that visualises the graffiti style classification system introduced by Lisa Gottlieb in her 2008 book:\
*Gottlieb, L. 2008. Graffiti art styles: A classification system and theoretical analysis. McFarland & Company: Jefferson, pp. viii, 212. ISBN: 978-0-7864-3436-7*\\

This small program was developed within the academic graffiti project INDIGO (https://projectindigo.eu). The program can be run in two different ways:

- the **GottliebStylesVisualiser.m** file holds the MATLAB R2022a source code. Download this file and run it in MATLAB to open the GSV. Please also download the **coverBookGottlieb.jpg** image file and place it in the same folder as the MATLAB *.m file.
- download the **InstallerGSV1.0.exe**. This file will install the GSV AND the MATLAB Runtime environment (v9.12). In this way, MATLAB is not needed to work with GSV. However, the file was compiled on Windows 10 and will not work on MacOS and Linux systems. When choosing this option, please be aware that [1] it takes some time for the Installer to open; [2] around 700 MB of data will be downloaded for the MATLAB Runtime Environment; [3] running the GSV for the first time takes some time, as will be the first use of the menu items. After that, the GSV should be much more responsive.\\
